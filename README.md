# Measuring What We Canâ€™t See
**A Data-Driven Look at the Invisible Work of Developers**

Modern development work is full of invisible effortâ€”decisions made, bugs avoided, knowledge sharedâ€”but most of that doesnâ€™t show up in dashboards or status updates.  
This article explores how we can responsibly measure what traditional metrics miss, using version control data as a starting point.

Included in this repo is a lightweight PowerShell script that generates a daily activity summary for your development team. It pulls insights from Git and GitHub to highlight:

- âœ… Commit frequency and impact  
- âœ… Pull request activity  
- âœ… Unreviewed or uncommented PRs  
- âœ… Last commit timestamps by team member

Itâ€™s designed to be simple, cross-platform, and transparentâ€”something you can start using immediately and extend as your teamâ€™s needs grow.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Clone the repo and update the script settings

Edit the `$settings` object in the script to include:

- Your SMTP server details  
- Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)  
- A mapping of team member email addresses to GitHub usernames

### 2. Run the script manually or via scheduled task

```bash
pwsh ./New-DailyTeamSummary.ps1 -RepoPath "/path/to/your/repo" -LeaderEmail "you@example.com"
```

- `RepoPath` is optional and defaults to the current working directory  
- `LeaderEmail` is required and specifies where to send the daily summary

### 3. What Youâ€™ll Receive

The script sends a styled HTML email to the designated team lead with:
- Commit counts  
- Adjusted impact (lines added/removed)  
- PRs opened  
- PRs assigned but not yet reviewed or commented on  
- Last commit timestamp per developer
